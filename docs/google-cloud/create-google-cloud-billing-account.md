# Create Google Billing Account

## Overview

The _Cloud Billing accounts_ are used to define who pays for a given set of Google Cloud resources and _Google Maps Platform APIs_. Access control to a Cloud Billing account is established by IAM roles. A Cloud Billing account is connected to a DoiT International [billing profile](../invoices-and-payments/setting-up-a-new-billing-profile.md).

Use these instructions to create a Google Cloud Billing Account and link it to your company's billing profile using the Cloud Management Platform.

## Create a new Billing Account

Start with you logging into the [Cloud Management Platform](https://app.doit-intl.com), and select _Manage Licenses & Assets_ from the main dashboard:

You will be prompted with a pop-up requesting you to enter your Google _Billing Account Name_, _Billing Profile_, and the email addresses of designated _Billing Account Administrators_.

Your domain is added as a _Billing Account User_ on the new Billing Accounts you create in the CMP. This allows anyone on the domain to link projects to the billing account.
{% endhint %}
