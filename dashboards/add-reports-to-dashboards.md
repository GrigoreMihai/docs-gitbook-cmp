# Adding Reports to a Dashboard

Dashboards provide a collective view into your most important reports. Create personal dashboards, project dashboards, or team dashboards depending on what you would like to track more closely.

Adding Cloud Analytics Reports into [customizable dashboards](customizing-dashboards.md), give you an at-a-glance view of your most important cloud infrastructure data points.

Required Permissions: **Cloud Analytics** \(part of 'Standard User' preset role\)
{% endhint %}

### Adding Reports to a Dashboard

Add your report to a dashboard by clicking the 'Add to dashboard' icon in the upper right-hand corner of the report.

This will make the report addable from your [Widgets Library](widgets-overview.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only chart-based reports can be added to your dashboards. The table-based and heatmap-based reports are currently not supported by dashboards.
{% endhint %}

Next, access any of your dashboards and open your Widgets Library by clicking on the "+" in the lower-right corner of your screen.

Finally, scroll down a bit until you see the "**Report Widgets**", and click on the report\(s\) you'd like to add to your dashboard.

From there, you're free to [customize](customizing-dashboards.md) the size and arrangement of the widgets as you see fit. Note that report data displayed in the widget will refresh every four hours. 

Limitations

* Only reports with chart visualizations \(i.e. not tables\) can be added as widgets.
