# Paying Invoices with Credit Card or ACH

You have the option to pay the open \(i.e., unpaid\) invoices with a credit card. We process the credit cards with an emphasis on the security of the provided information. 

**Required Permissions:**

At a minimum, to pay for Invoices, you must be granted the following permissions:

* Invoice Viewer
* Billing Profiles Assignments

To pay for an invoice, please select the '**Pay Now**' button, located on the top right-hand corner of the page.

Once clicking on 'Pay Now', a popup to enter your credit card details will appear. If you haven't entered the credit card details in the past, you'll need to do that here.

Furthermore, you may partially pay for an invoice by manually editing the amount. See the below example for reference.

For customers that have already paid with a credit card in the past, the window will appear with the history of your cards that were previously used. If you see more than one credit card, please select one from the list with which you'd like to pay this invoice.

After clicking on 'Pay Now' your order transaction will begin to be processed, and once approved by the credit card processor, you will receive the following notification on the bottom left-hand corner of your page. If the payment was successful, the status of the invoice will be switched to '**Paid**'.
