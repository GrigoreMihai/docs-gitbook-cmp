# Escalating Support Requests

If you would like to access and review previously submitted support requests, you can easily do so through the Cloud Management Platform \(i.e., [https://hello.doit-intl.com](https://hello.doit-intl.com/)\). 

From the main dashboard please select '**Access Support**'.

You can locate tickets that are currently 'In Progress', and by enabling the 'Show Closed Tickets' finder, see the archived tickets. 

By clicking on 'View Ticket', you are brought to a new page which includes the full description and in-depth details.

Click on the 'Escalate' button to escalate the ticket and specify the reason for escalation.

Available Escalation Reasoning:

* Long Resolution Time
* Business Impact
* Technical Expertise
* Other

Once you select the reason for escalation, you can also add comments further explaining and justifying the escalation.
