# Metric Trend Analysis

Oftentimes when analyzing our cloud usage, we're overwhelmed with so many data points that it becomes impossible to identify important trends. **Trend Analysis** helps you cut through the "noise" and isolate what is trending upward or downward in a single click.

Use Trend Analysis in your Cloud Analytics Reports by selecting an option from the "**ML Features**" dropdown on the lefthand set of options.

See how it works in the video below.
