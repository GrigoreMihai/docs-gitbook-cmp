# Purchase Flex RIs

Flexible Reserved Instances provide you with a 22% discount over on-demand EC2 pricing while allowing you to commit to instances in one-month intervals.

DoiT International has developed a proprietary technology to provide our customers with month-to-month discounts based on the reserved instances in your AWS environment. In order to get the benefits of Flexible RIs, your AWS account/s should be consolidated with DoiT International as your channel reseller.

_Please note that new orders and editing previous orders can only be generated up to the 25th day of the month. After this timeframe, each order will become **Pending** for internal review and processing by our team._

For each order of Flexible Reservations, you'll see one or both of the following lines on your monthly invoice:

* Flexible RI \#ID Savings
* Flexible RI \#ID Underutilization

The "Flexible RI Savings" will state the amount you have saved due to the purchase of Flexible Reservation/s for a given month.

The optional "Flexible RI Underutilization" will state the amount deducted from the cost of the reservation if the underlying instance wasn't utilized 100% of the time during the month.

View the bite-sized video below for a closer look at purchasing and viewing your Flex RIs.
