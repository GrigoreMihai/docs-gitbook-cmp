## Troubleshooting

### I don't see any billing accounts in my Google Cloud Organization

Make sure you have Billing Account Administrator permissions on your billing account in question. Please contact your Google Cloud administrator if you believe you don't.

### I can't change billing for the projects listed

To change billing account for a project you need to have proper permissions on the project itself. Usually having Billing Account Administrator on your whole Google Cloud Organization or the project in question is enough.

### While trying to select a new Billing Account no DoiT billing accounts appear on the list

Make sure you have access to the target Billing Account. To verify, please go to hello.doit-intl.com and check if your name is on the list:

If it's not, please contact one of the persons who are on the list to add you.
