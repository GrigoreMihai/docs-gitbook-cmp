**Notifications:**

* _New Invoices_ - an email will be sent when a new invoice is uploaded to the Cloud Management Platform
* _Cost Anomalies_ - request to be notified when our system detects abnormal usage of your cloud platform \(i.e., AWS or Google Cloud\)
* _Payment Reminders_ - an email will be sent reminding the user to pay the invoice. There are three different instances of when notifications are sent:
  1. The first reminder is sent seven days before the invoice's due date
  2. The second reminder is sent four days after the invoice's due date
  3. The third reminder is sent 10 days after the invoice's due date
* _Credit Alerts_ - request to be notified when your credits are nearly exhausted and have been exhausted
