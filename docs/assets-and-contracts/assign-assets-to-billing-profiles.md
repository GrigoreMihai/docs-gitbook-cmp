# Assign Assets to Billing Profiles

You can assign assets to [Billing Profiles](../invoices-and-payments/setting-up-a-new-billing-profile.md) for invoicing purposes. Since every Billing Profile receives its own monthly invoice, how you assign assets will affect how each entity is billed.

Once you're at the Assets page, switch to the relevant asset, locate the ellipsis icon, and click on 'Billing Profile Assignment'.
