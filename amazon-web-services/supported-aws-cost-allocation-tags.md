# AWS Cost Allocation Tags

We have enabled the following user-defined tags \(case sensitive\) across our AWS consolidated billing accounts:

* Alias

* billing
* Env
* env
* Environment
* environment
* Name
* Owner
* owner
* Product
* product
* Project

Ideally, you will be using one of these tags to track your AWS cost allocations. If you need a custom cost allocation tag, please open a support ticket using http://support.doit-intl.com
