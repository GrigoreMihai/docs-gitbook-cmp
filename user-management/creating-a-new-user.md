The recipient(s) you invited will receive an email, which you will be cc'd on, inviting them to complete the sign up and use the CMP.

### Editing User Profiles

There are two ways you can access the page to edit a user's profile:

* Check the "Continue to editing user profile" box when initially inviting them.
* Click on their email in your Users list.

When editing a profile, you have four sections:

1. **Profile** - Set name, job function, and phone number of the user
2. **Permissions** - [Assign a role](manage-roles.md) to the user, which contains the [set of permissions](user-permissions-explained.md) they have.
3. **Notifications **- Determine which events you'd like the user to be notified on.
4. **API **- [Generate an API key](https://developer.doit-intl.com/docs/start) that lets you programmatically access CMP features.

In the "Bulk Update Users" pop-up, make your bulk changes. This can include updating multiple users' job function, role, and/or notifications.

Once you've made your desired changes, click on the "Update" button to confirm them.

You may also bulk delete users from your organization. Simply click on the "Delete" button and confirm your decision after.
