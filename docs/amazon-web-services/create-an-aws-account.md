# Create An AWS Account

As a customer, you can create a new AWS account directly from the Cloud Management Platform.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note you must be assigned access to the specific Billing Profile under which the domain is managed in order to create a new account.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
You will see an **OrganizationAccountAccessRole** in the new AWS account. This role is created by AWS and links back to the parent account. When creating the account we will use this role to [create the CloudHealth IAM Role](https://help.doit-intl.com/amazon-web-services/set-up-cloudhealth). The CMP or DoiT International will not use this role afterwards and you will have to **manually remove this role from your account**
{% endhint %}

* Log into the [Cloud Management Platform](https://app.doit-intl.com)
* Click on the "setting" âš™ icon located at the top right side of the navigation bar
* Click on "assets" under "cloud settings"&#x20;
* Once you're at the Assets page, go to the right-hand side of the page and click on '**Invite Account**'.

On the right-hand side of the page, click the bottom facing arrow and choosing 'Create Account'.
