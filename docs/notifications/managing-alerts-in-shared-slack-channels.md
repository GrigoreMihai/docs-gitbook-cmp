# Slack Notifications

If you have a shared Slack channel with DoiT International, you may now opt-in to receive alerts for:

* Detected [cost anomalies](../anomaly-detection/cloud-anomalies.md)
* [Known Issues](../tickets/cloud-infrastructure-known-issues.md) in Google Cloud and AWS
* Cloud Quota Alerts for [Google Cloud](https://help.doit-intl.com/google-cloud/google-cloud-quotas) and [AWS](https://help.doit-intl.com/amazon-web-services/aws-quotas)

To set up notifications, click the Settings cog in the top-right part of the main navigation and select Slack from the dropdown.

We will automatically detect whether your team has a shared Slack channel with us, so all you need to do is select which notifications you'd like to opt-in. When you're done, click on "Update"

Note that for Cost Anomalies, there is an additional step of selecting the minimum threshold (Information, Warning, or Critical) of anomalies you'd like to be notified on.
