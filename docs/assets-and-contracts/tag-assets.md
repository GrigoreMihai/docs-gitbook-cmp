# Tag Assets

Assets in DoiT Cloud Management Platform (CMP) refer to your Billing Accounts for Google Cloud, Accounts for AWS, or Subscriptions for Google Workspace, Microsoft Azure, or Office.

You can tag an asset for classification purposes. Tags will appear on invoices so you will be able to identify invoice items easier. The best practice is to tag assets with a term or keyword like team name, cost center, location, or any tagging convention used in your organization.

Note that only one tag is allowed per asset. To add tags to assets, see the following instructions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Required Role\*\*: Admin\*\*
{% endhint %}

1. Navigate to 'Assets' from the menu on the left-hand side of CMP
2. Select the 'Asset Type' you want to tag (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)
3. Click the 3-dot menu
4. Select 'Tag Asset'
5. Input a new tag or select from the list of previously created tags.
6. Click Save

All new tags you save will be added on the tag selection list and will be available to use for other assets.
