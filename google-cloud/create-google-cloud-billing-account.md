# Create Google Billing Account

### Overview

The Cloud Billing accounts are used to define who pays for a given set of Google Cloud resources and Google Maps Platform APIs. Access control to a Cloud Billing account is established by  IAM roles. A Cloud Billing account is connected to a DoiT International [billing profile](../invoices-and-payments/setting-up-a-new-billing-profile.md).

Use these instructions to create a Google Cloud Billing Account/s and link it to your company billing profile using the Cloud Management Platform.
