After clicking on a category, you can search for ideas by their sub-categories on the left-hand side. Additionally, you can sort through them via categories such as "Hot", "Top Ideas", "New", or "Status".

If an idea has been added to the roadmap or development has begun, you will see a colored status icon similar to the yellow "Planned" rectangle in the screenshot below.

Upvote an idea that interests you by clicking on the "Vote" button next to the idea. Finally — if you aren't signed in already — enter your email or sign in with Google to submit your vote.

You will be notified as the status of the idea changes and ultimately gets released in the product it corresponds to.
