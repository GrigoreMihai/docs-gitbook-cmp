# Manage Roles

Users Roles make it easy to bulk-assign permissions and manage users more efficiently in your organization.

### Built-in Roles

There are 5 built-in roles in your account. These roles are pre-created by the Cloud Management Platform for your convenience. 

* **Basic** - access to raise service requests and access to the existing service requests
* **IT Manager** -  License Manager \(+Basic permissions\)
* **Finance User** - Billing Profile Admin, Invoice Viewer \(+Basic permissions\)
* **Standard** - Cloud Analytics, Sandbox User, superQuery \(+Basic permissions\)
* **Power User** - Flexible RIs, Sandbox Admin and Settings \(+Standard permissions\)
* **Admin** - Access to everything

### Custom Roles

If one of the built-in roles doesn't work for you, you can create a custom role. To create a custom user role, select the "Users and Roles" icon in the lefthand navigation bar.

From there, navigate to the "Roles" tab. You will see a list of Preset Roles, as well as any other Custom Roles created by your team.

Create a new role by clicking on the "**+ NEW** " button at the top right of the screen. This opens a new page with a [list of permissions](user-permissions-explained.md) available to group into the new role.

To get started:

1. Give your new User Role a good name.
2. _**Optional:**_ Give the role a description to give additional context around who the role is for.
3. Select the permissions you'd like the role to contain.

### Editing a Custom Role

{% hint style="info" %}
You can't edit built-in roles.
{% endhint %}

To modify the permissions contained in a custom role, check the box next to the role you'd like to edit, then click on the "Edit Role" icon at the top-right of your screen.

From there, make your edits to the permissions the role contains. When finished, click on the **&lt;--** back arrow icon at the top-left to return to the main Roles page.

### Deleting a Custom Role

To delete the custom role, you would need to make sure there are no users configured with this role. The CMP will not allow removing the role until this condition is satisfied. 

Select the role you'd like to delete and click the "Remove" button. You will need to confirm your action and the role will be removed.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can't remove built-in roles.
{% endhint %}
