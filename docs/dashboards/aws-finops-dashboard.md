# AWS Lens

Having full visibility into your services' operations and being accountable for your cloud finances to fully manage costs is crucial, whether fixed or variable. Use this dashboard to decide how and when to optimize costs, monitor performance, and more. The AWS Lens dashboard will show up if you have Amazon Web Services accounts.

From the list of dashboards, select '**AWS Lens**' to access the dashboard. Each of the preset widgets serves its own purpose (see below):
