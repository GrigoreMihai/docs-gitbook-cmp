# Flexible Reservations Overview

## Overview

Flexible Reserved Instances let you commit to EC2 Reserved Instances in one-month intervals while still sharing in the AWS-listed RI commitment discount. With Flex RIs, you'll eliminate RI lock-in risk for your less predictable workloads.

In order to use Flexible Reservations, your AWS account/s should be consolidated with DoiT International billing organization. DoiT International is a global [AWS Advanced Channel Reseller](https://partners.amazonaws.com/partners/001E000001HPlIAIA1/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that new orders and editing previous orders can only be submitted up until the last 24 hours of the current month. After that date, orders will become **Pending** while we conduct an internal review before activating your Flexible Reservations.
{% endhint %}

## Monitoring Flex RIs

At the top of the Flex RI page, you'll see four Flex RI Reporting metrics that give you a high-level overview of your past and existing Flex RI purchases:

* **Total Expected Savings** - the maximum amount you could have saved, given 100% utilization
* **Actual Savings** - the amount you actually saved
* **Flexible Reservation Utilization** - a weighted FlexRI percentage of orders utilization
* **YTD Savings** - the total saving across all your reservations, from the beginning of the current year.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The first three metrics are based on what is shown in the table, meaning taking into account any filters you've set on your orders. The last metric takes _every_ Flex RI order into account when calculating the number.
{% endhint %}

### Flex RI Order Statuses

Under the "Status" column, Flex RI orders can have four possible values:

* **New**: the order was made, but goes into effect in the following month or beyond \(if a recurring purchase is set up\). New orders can be modified until the third-to-last business day of the month prior to when they go into effect.
* **Active**: the Flex RI order is currently being applied to the instance\(s\) specified
* **Retired**: the order is past its expiration date
* **Canceled**: the order was canceled and never applied

To view usage statistics on a specific order, click on the arrow next to an active or retired order to expand your order and view more details.

You can see the difference between the on-demand price per hour vs. the Flex RI, and further inspect the utilization graph for additional details on your flexible reservation.

## Flex RI Invoices

For each order of Flexible Reservations, you'll see one or both of the following lines on your monthly invoice:

* Flexible RI \#ID Savings
* Flexible RI \#ID Underutilization

The "Flexible RI Savings" will state the amount you have saved due to the purchase of Flexible Reservation/s for a given month.

The optional "Flexible RI Underutilization" will state the amount deducted from the cost of the reservation if the underlying instance wasn't utilized 100% of the time during the month.
