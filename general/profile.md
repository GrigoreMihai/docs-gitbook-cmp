# Your Profile

You can access and edit your user profile to adjust your personal details and/or notifications settings. To access your profile settings, click your profile icon in the upper-right corner of the page header, then select **Profile.**

You will be taken to a Profile page, where you'll find the following tabs:

* Profile
* Permissions
* Notifications
* API

Let's go over what can be configured in each tab.

### Profile

* **First / Last Name**
* **Job Function**
* **Phone Number**
* **Default Dashboard** - the default dashboard that appears in your "Home" page whenever you log in.

### Permissions

This is where you can view your [CMP Role](../user-management/manage-roles.md) \(and the associated permissions that come with it\) and assign yourself to any [Billing Profiles](../invoices-and-payments/setting-up-a-new-billing-profile.md) \(if you have the Admin role\).

### **Notifications**

You can request to be notified on the following events:

**New Invoices** - an email will be sent when a new invoice is uploaded to the Cloud Management Platform

**Credits Utilization** - request to be notified when your credits are 75% exhausted and then again once they have been fully exhausted.

**Cloud Quota Utilization** - notifies you when you exceed 50% usage of any of your Google Cloud and/or AWS service quotas.

**Cost Anomalies** - request to be notified when our system detects abnormal usage of your cloud platform \(i.e., AWS and/or Google Cloud\). Additionally, you can set at which threshold \(Information, Warning, Critical\) you'd like to be notified.

**Payment Due/Overdue** - an email will be sent reminding the user to pay the invoice. There are three different instances of when notifications are sent:

1. [ ] The first reminder is sent seven days before an invoice is due.
2. [ ] The second reminder is sent four days after the invoice's due date.
3. [ ] The third reminder is sent 10 days after the invoice's due date.

**Cloud** [**Known Issues**](../tickets/cloud-infrastructure-known-issues.md) ****- get alerted whenever there is an infrastructure issue with Google Cloud and/or AWS that may affect your own workloads.

### API

This is where you go to generate your API key in order to [programmatically access several CMP features](../apis/developer-hub.md).

After you generate your key, copy and store it somewhere handy, as we won't show it again after you leave the API page.
