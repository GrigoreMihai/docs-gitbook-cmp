# Auto-Increase Subscriptions

As a customer, you are able to configure a G Suite subscription to increase automatically once the amount of licenses falls short of the configurable threshold.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that you must be assigned access to the specific Billing Profile under which the domain is managed in order to configure auto-increase.
{% endhint %}

From the main dashboard please select '**Manage Licenses & Assets**'.

Configure the number of licenses you want to have available at all times. Once licenses get assigned to users in your organization, a new license/s will be added automatically.
