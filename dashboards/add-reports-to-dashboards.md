# Adding Reports to a Dashboard

Transforming your Cloud Analytics Reports into widgets allows you to [customize dashboards](customizing-dashboards.md), or [create new](creating-a-new-dashboard.md) ones, that give you an at-a-glance view of your most important cloud infrastructure data points.

{% hint style="info" %}
Required Permissions: **Cloud Analytics**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can only use preset reports or custom reports for which you have Edit access as widgets 
{% endhint %}

Enable your report as an addable widget by switching to Edit mode for the report, and clicking the toggle at the far-right of your screen. This will make the report addable from your [Widgets Library](widgets-overview.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only reports with chart visualizations \(i.e. not table or heatmap-based reports\) can be added as widgets to your dashboards.
{% endhint %}

Next, access any of your dashboards and open your Widgets Library by clicking on the "+" in the lower-right corner of your screen.

Finally, scroll down a bit until you see the "**Report Widgets**", and click on the report\(s\) you'd like to add to your dashboard.

From there, you're free to [customize](customizing-dashboards.md) the size and arrangement of the widgets as you see fit. Note that report data displayed in the widget will refresh every four hours. 

Limitations

* Only reports with chart visualizations \(i.e. not tables\) can be added as widgets.
