# Create Google Billing Account

### Overview

The _Cloud Billing accounts_ are used to define who pays for a given set of Google Cloud resources and _Google Maps Platform APIs_. Access control to a Cloud Billing account is established by IAM roles. A Cloud Billing account is connected to a DoiT International [billing profile](../invoices-and-payments/setting-up-a-new-billing-profile.md).

Use these instructions to create a Google Cloud Billing Account and link it to your company's billing profile using the Cloud Management Platform.
