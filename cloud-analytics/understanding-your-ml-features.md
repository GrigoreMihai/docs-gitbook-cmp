Let's go over the effect each ML Feature has on your reports.

**Trending Up**

Using the [Mann-Kendall](https://www.statisticshowto.com/mann-kendall-trend-test/) algorithm, this ML Feature removes "noise" from your charts and only shows results that are trending up in your selected [Metric](https://help.doit-intl.com/cloud-analytics/editing-your-cloud-report#metric-options) \(i.e. Cost\).

**Trending Down**

Similar to the "Trending Up" feature, "Trending Down" displays results that are trending down for your metric within your selected Time Range.
