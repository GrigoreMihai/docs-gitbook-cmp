# Invite Existing AWS Account

You can add existing AWS accounts to DoiT International's consolidated billing using the Cloud Management Platform \(i.e., [hello.doit-intl.com](https://hello.doit-intl.com/)\).

**Required Permission:**

At a minimum, to Invite an Existing AWS Account, you must be granted the following permission:

* Licenses Manager

_Please note that you must be assigned access to the specific Billing Profile under which the domain is managed in order to invite an existing account._

From the main dashboard please select '**Manage Licenses & Assets**'.

Another way to access the 'Invite AWS Account' is via the menu on the left-hand side of the page and clicking on Assets.

Once you're at the Assets page, go to the right-hand side of the page and click on '**Invite Account**'.

Choose the Billing Profile to which you'd like to have the existing AWS account now be a part of. Enter the 12-digit AWS Account ID and any optional notes before clicking 'Invite'.

An email will be sent on behalf of AWS.

If within five minutes you haven't received the above email, please re-enter your AWS Account ID in the DoiT Cloud Management Platform and invite once again. 

To complete the process please visit the AWS documentation on "[Inviting an AWS Account to Join Your Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_invites.html#orgs_manage_accounts_accept-decline-invite)" and search for the "To accept or decline an invitation \(console\)" section.

After signing in to the AWS Console and accepting the invitation, a final email will be sent instructing how to complete the IAM access for CloudHealth.
